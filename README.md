# BoilerplatePP

This repo is a Cookiecutter template for new C++ Projects, I will use for all my future C++ projects.
There are still a lot of ideas, tasks and other issues I am working on in my free time so stay tuned!

## Usage

1. Make sure you have [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) installed. If not take a look at [its documentation](http://cookiecutter.rtfd.org/).
2. Run `cookiecutter https://github.com/Paspartout/BoilerplatePP` in your Terminal.
3. Your brand new C++ project should be aviable in your given repo_name.

## Built upon great projects

- [Catch](http://catch-lib.net/) for lightweight and easy to use TDD or BDD
- [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) as a great tool to create projects from templates
